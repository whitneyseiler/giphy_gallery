//LED SIGN

1) research programming an LED SIGN
  - Javascript specific
  - any programs that I might need
  - look for example code

2) map out letter placement
  - establish rules about letter dimensions (considering dimension of the sign)
    - e.g. max width = 16, max height = 16
    - e.g. "T" = determine left arm length, center stem width, right arm length;
  - draw on graph paper or sketch program

3) handle rendering stationary text on home machine
  - add border to cells and view in browser/preview
  - iterate over grid, check for coordinates of letter and turn cell on/fill cell accordingly
  - populate two dimensional array with booleans indicating whether cell will be turned on/lit on sign

3) handle stationary text on LED sign
  example: "HELLO"
  - iterate over two dimensional array and, using LED programming learned from research, get sign to display text
    - if cell value is true, light up that cell

4) handle animation/scrolling
  - set farthest left coordinate of letter to last cell in grid row (right edge of screen)
  - on timeout or other automation, shift left coordinate of every cell in letter one cell left
  - continue for all letters



//GREETING CARD FOR ALIENS

1) what information would be useful to aliens?
  - sounds (languages, nature, industry, culture)
  - images (typical human attire, homes, cars, animals)
  - instruction ilustrations for consuming media (e.g. needle on record)

  - if sending HTML for viewing in alien browser:
    - include all necessary dependencies (including browser and environment) with simple script for installing
    - include instructions for loading in browser
    - instructions for navigating (selection options e.g. click, touch)
    - table of contents
    - README



// PARKING LOT

1) dimension of building foundation 
2) max height or number of floors
  - if max height, determine standard ceiling height in a parking garage (based on car height)
  - consider who is parking in garage 
    - how necessary it is to accomodate tall vehicles
    - whats target audience/user base 
    - consider market competition
    - consider building/maintenance cost, estimated profit based on certain numbers of spaces
3) sketch one floor
  - where are entrance and exit? probably determined by street location
  - 
4) EXIT EFFICIENCY
  - use model where customers pay before exiting
  - have as many exit lanes as possible
  - is express exit possible?
  - ensure layout leaves enough room for traffic and cars parking/leaving spaces
  -
